## 🏗️ Architecture

```
[Producer Thread]  --push-->  [Ring Buffer]  --pop-->  [Consumer Thread]
 (Market Data)                (1024 capacity)           (Matching Engine)
                              (Lock-Free)
```

## ✨ Features

### Phase 1: Matching Engine
- ✅ Order book with `BTreeMap` for sorted price levels
- ✅ Limit order matching with spread-crossing detection
- ✅ Buy/Sell order support
- ✅ Real-time trade execution

### Phase 2: Lock-Free Ring Buffer
- ✅ SPSC lock-free queue using `rtrb` crate
- ✅ Producer thread with backpressure handling
- ✅ Consumer thread with busy-wait optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive performance measurement
- ✅ Zero-copy order transmission

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))

### Run the Benchmark

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nanosecond-arbiter.git
cd nanosecond-arbiter

# Run in release mode (optimized)
cargo run --release
```

### Run Phase 1 (Matching Engine Only)

```bash
rustc matching_engine.rs -O
./matching_engine  # or matching_engine.exe on Windows
```

## 📖 What You'll Learn

This project demonstrates:

- **Lock-Free Programming**: SPSC ring buffer with atomic operations
- **Performance Engineering**: 10-50x faster than mutex-based queues
- **Systems Design**: HFT-grade architecture patterns
- **Rust Concurrency**: Safe multi-threading without data races
- **Benchmarking**: Proper latency and throughput measurement

## 🔧 Can I Use This for My Own Projects?

**YES! This pattern works for ANY data type, not just trading orders!**

The lock-free ring buffer pattern can be adapted for:
- 🎥 **Video Processing**: Camera → Encoder pipelines
- 🌡️ **IoT Sensors**: Sensor data → Database logging
- 🎮 **Game Engines**: Game logic → Render thread
- 🎵 **Audio Processing**: Input → Effects → Output
- 🌐 **Network Processing**: Packet RX → Protocol handler

**See [USAGE_GUIDE.md](USAGE_GUIDE.md) for complete examples and templates!**

Just replace `Order` with your data type:
```rust
// Your data type
struct VideoFrame { /* ... */ }

// Same pattern!
let (producer, consumer) = RingBuffer::<VideoFrame>::new(1024);
```

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Why Lock-Free?

| Approach | Latency | Characteristics |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Mutex-based** | ~25-50ns | Context switches, kernel involvement |
| **Lock-free (rtrb)** | ~1-5ns | Atomic operations, CPU-level only |
| **This implementation** | **19ns** | Includes order creation + processing |

### Key Optimizations

1. **Lock-Free Queue**: `rtrb` crate for zero mutex overhead
2. **Aggressive Compiler Flags**: LTO, single codegen unit
3. **Zero-Copy**: Orders passed by value, no heap allocations
4. **Cache-Friendly**: Ring buffer keeps data in CPU cache
5. **Spin-Wait**: Lower latency than blocking for HFT workloads
